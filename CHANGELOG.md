## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-15

### Added
- **Tool-Based LLM Architecture**: Complete refactoring of LLM service to use modular, plugin-based tool architecture
  - Created `BaseLLMTool` abstract base class for all LLM tools
  - Implemented `ToolRegistry` for dynamic tool registration and discovery
  - Added 7 specialized tools: Summarization, Markdown Formatting, Entity Extraction, Classification, Language Detection, Question Answering, and Embeddings
  - Each tool is now self-contained (~100-200 lines) and independently testable

- **Auto-Discovery Tool Registration System**: Decorator-based automatic tool registration
  - Implemented `@register_tool` decorator for zero-configuration tool registration
  - Support for tool aliases (e.g., TEXT_TO_MARKDOWN â†’ MARKDOWN_FORMATTING)
  - Eliminated all manual tool registration code
  - Tools now self-register on import

- **Dynamic Configuration System**: Config-driven capabilities and health checks
  - Health check capabilities are now dynamically generated from registered tools
  - Removed all hardcoded capability lists
  - Added `_get_dynamic_capabilities()` method for runtime capability discovery
  - Capability mapping from technical tool capabilities to user-friendly names

- **Document Processing Improvements**:
  - Created `DocumentProcessor` service following existing service patterns
  - Centralized document processing orchestration
  - Eliminated code duplication between queue service implementations
  - Added support for multiple document types (PDF, Text, JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, Media, Webpage)
  - Integrated progress callbacks for real-time processing updates

- **Redis Queue Service Enhancements**:
  - Fixed metadata field errors by storing processing metadata in Redis separately
  - Improved error handling with WebSocket notifications
  - Added retry mechanism with configurable retry counts
  - Better status management and progress tracking

### Changed
- **LLM Service Refactoring**:
  - Reduced from 894 lines monolithic service to 531 lines orchestrator
  - Converted 8 hardcoded methods to pluggable tools
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API
  - Improved separation of concerns with tool-specific logic

- **Service Registration**:
  - Changed from manual registration (22 lines) to auto-discovery (3 lines)
  - Tools now use decorators for registration instead of explicit registration calls
  - Registration is triggered automatically on module import

### Fixed
- Fixed "DocumentMetadata has no field processing_started_at" error in Redis queue
- Fixed "LLMService has no attribute text_to_markdown" error
- Fixed Entity class import error in services __init__.py
- Fixed retry count storage in Redis queue service
- Fixed last_error field storage in Redis queue service

### Technical Improvements
- **Modularity**: Each LLM tool is now an independent, focused module
- **Scalability**: New AI capabilities can be added by creating new tool classes
- **Testability**: Tools can be tested in isolation without the full service
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one tool don't affect others
- **Consistency**: Follows established service/factory patterns throughout
- **Type Safety**: Decorators enforce proper type usage
- **Performance**: Dynamic capability generation with caching

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-14

### Initial Release
- Basic document processing platform
- Service factory pattern implementation
- OpenTelemetry observability
