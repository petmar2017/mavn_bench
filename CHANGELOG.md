## [Unreleased]

### Pagination and Document Management Improvements (2025-01-14 - Late)
- **Backend Pagination Implementation**:
  - Added sorting by `updated_at` descending in filesystem storage for consistent document ordering
  - Fixed missing `list_all()` method in storage adapters (filesystem and Redis)
  - Added PaginationConfig to central configuration with default settings:
    - Default limit: 20 documents per page
    - Max limit: 100 documents
    - Default sort: updated_at descending
  - All document listings now properly sorted with most recent first

- **Frontend Infinite Scroll**:
  - Implemented infinite scroll in DocumentList component with 200px threshold
  - Added scroll event handler with automatic pagination loading
  - Proper deduplication and re-sorting when appending new documents
  - Loading indicator shows "Loading more documents..." during fetch
  - "End of documents" message when all documents are loaded
  - Smooth user experience without jarring refreshes

- **PDF Processing Fix**:
  - Temporarily disabled LLM validation step that was causing PDF processing to hang
  - PDFs now complete processing successfully and show as "completed" status
  - Identified issue in queue_service.py where LLM validation was timing out

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Added comprehensive "Build for Scale - Pagination & Data Management" section to prompt.md
  - Documented backend sorting implementation requirements
  - Documented frontend infinite scroll specifications
  - Added API contract documentation for pagination endpoints

### Document Processing Status Fix (2025-01-14 - Night/Continued)
- **Fixed Document List Display Issue**:
  - Documents weren't appearing in the document list after upload despite successful upload confirmation
  - Root cause: Frontend filter `!doc.metadata.deleted` was removing ALL documents because undefined evaluates as falsy in JavaScript
  - Changed filter to only exclude documents where `deleted === true` explicitly
  - Documents now properly appear in the list immediately after upload

- **Processing Status Standardization**:
  - Fixed "Waiting for processing..." status that never updated to completed
  - Backend was hardcoding `processing_status: "completed"` regardless of actual document state
  - Updated all API endpoints to use actual `metadata.processing_status` property
  - Standardized entire codebase on single source of truth for document status

- **Backend API Improvements**:
  - Fixed `/api/documents` endpoint (line 453) to return actual processing_status from metadata
  - Updated `/api/documents/{id}` endpoint (lines 193, 690, 801) to use metadata.processing_status property
  - All search endpoints now consistently use metadata.processing_status property
  - Documents created with correct ProcessingStage.PENDING or ProcessingStage.COMPLETED based on type

- **Architecture Cleanup**:
  - Clarified that `processing_stage` is the actual field in DocumentMetadata
  - `processing_status` is a @property that returns the string value for frontend compatibility
  - Removed all hardcoded status values in favor of actual metadata values
  - Ensured consistent status tracking throughout document lifecycle

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Removed jarring 5-second refresh interval based on user feedback
  - Documents now show correct processing status immediately
  - Status properly transitions from pending → processing → completed/failed
  - Fixed timing issues where WebSocket messages arrived before UI was ready

### Frontend UI Standardization (2025-01-14 - Night)
